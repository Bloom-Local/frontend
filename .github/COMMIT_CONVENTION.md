## Git Commit Message Convention

> This is adapted from [Angular's commit convention](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/conventional-changelog/tree/master/packages/conventional-changelog-angular).


### Commit Message Format

Each commit message consists of a **header**, a **body** and a **footer**. The header has a special
format that includes a **type**, a **scope** and a **subject**:

```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>
<BLANK LINE>
<body>
<BLANK LINE>
<footer>
```

The **header** is mandatory and the **scope** of the header is optional.

Any line of the commit message cannot be longer 100 characters! This allows the message to be easier
to read on GitHub as well as in various git tools.

Footer should contain a [closing reference to an issue](https://help.github.com/articles/closing-issues-via-commit-messages/) if any.


### Revert

If the commit reverts a previous commit, it should begin with `revert: `, followed by the header of the reverted commit. In the body, it should say: `This reverts commit <hash>.`, where the hash is the SHA of the commit being reverted.


### Type

Must be one of the following:

* **build**: Changes that affect the build system or external dependencies
* **ci**: Changes to our CI configuration files and scripts 
* **docs**: Documentation only changes
* **feature**: A new feature
* **bugfix**: A bug fix
* **perf**: A code change that improves performance
* **refactor**: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
* **style**: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, missing semi-colons, etc)
* **test**: Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests

### Scope

The scope should be the name of the npm package affected (as perceived by person reading changelog generated from commit messages.

The following is the list of supported scopes:

* **common**
* **core**
* **sample**
* **microservices**
* **testing**
* **websockets**

There are currently a few exceptions to the "use package name" rule:

* **packaging**: used for changes that change the npm package layout in all of our packages, e.g. public path changes, package.json changes done to all packages, d.ts file/format changes, changes to bundles, etc.
* **changelog**: used for updating the release notes in CHANGELOG.md
* **sample/#**: for the example apps directory, replacing # with the example app number
* none/empty string: useful for `style`, `test` and `refactor` changes that are done across all packages (e.g. `style: add missing semicolons`)


### Subject

The subject contains a succinct description of the change:

* use the imperative, present tense: "change" not "changed" nor "changes"
* don't capitalize the first letter
* no dot (.) at the end

### Body

Just as in the **subject**, use the imperative, present tense: "change" not "changed" nor "changes".
The body should include the motivation for the change and contrast this with previous behavior.

### Footer

The footer should contain any information about **Breaking Changes** and is also the place to
reference GitHub issues that this commit **Closes**.

**Breaking Changes** should start with the word `BREAKING CHANGE:` with a space or two newlines. The rest of the commit message is then used for this.

A detailed explanation can be found in this [document][commit-message-format].


#### Examples

Appears under "Features" header, `compiler` subheader:

```
feat(compiler): add 'comments' option
```

Appears under "Bug Fixes" header, `v-model` subheader, with a link to issue #28:

```
fix(v-model): handle events on blur

close #28
```

Appears under "Performance Improvements" header, and under "Breaking Changes" with the breaking change explanation:

```
perf(core): improve vdom diffing by removing 'foo' option

BREAKING CHANGE: The 'foo' option has been removed.
```

The following commit and commit `667ecc1` do not appear in the changelog if they are under the same release. If not, the revert commit appears under the "Reverts" header.

```
revert: feat(compiler): add 'comments' option

This reverts commit 667ecc1654a317a13331b17617d973392f415f02.
```
